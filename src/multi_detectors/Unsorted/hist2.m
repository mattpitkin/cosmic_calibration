% function histmat  = hist2(x, y, xedges, yedges)
%
% Extract 2D histogram data containing the number of events
% of [x , y] pairs that fall in each bin of the grid defined by 
% xedges and yedges. The edges are vectors with monotonically 
% non-decreasing values.  
%
%EXAMPLE 
%
% events = 1000000;
% x1 = sqrt(0.05)*randn(events,1)-0.5; x2 = sqrt(0.05)*randn(events,1)+0.5;
% y1 = sqrt(0.05)*randn(events,1)+0.5; y2 = sqrt(0.05)*randn(events,1)-0.5;
% x= [x1;x2]; y = [y1;y2];
%
%For linearly spaced edges:
% xedges = linspace(-1,1,64); yedges = linspace(-1,1,64);
% histmat = hist2(x, y, xedges, yedges);
% figure; pcolor(xedges,yedges,histmat'); colorbar ; axis square tight ;
%
%For nonlinearly spaced edges:
% xedges_ = logspace(0,log10(3),64)-2; yedges_ = linspace(-1,1,64);
% histmat_ = hist2(x, y, xedges_, yedges_);
% figure; pcolor(xedges_,yedges_,histmat_'); colorbar ; axis square tight ;
